# RxAppKit

## Why create this
RxCocoa provides many convenient bindings and observables for iOS, but few for macOS.

The framework aims to provide rich extensions to RxSwift for macOS. The project is experimental and the API is subject to change.

## Thanks
The objc swizzle code comes from [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa)
